# Invaders
## Arcade game remake in CSharp

Invaders is the final project of Stellman & Greene's [*Head First C#*](http://www.headfirstlabs.com/books/hfcsharp/).

The book gives some guidance in the form of program architecture and class diagrams, 
the rest is left up to the reader to implement.

The game still needs some tweaking to get the difficulty right and
also a rewrite of the invaders' returnFire() method.

## How to play

Press **S** to start.

Move left or right with the **arrow keys**.

Fire at the invaders to score using the **space bar**.

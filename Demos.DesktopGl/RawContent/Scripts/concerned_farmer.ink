There is a lot of tension politically.
The Ninja Village has been putting a lot of pressure on the kingdom.
I hope nothing bad happens to the princess because of this.
*   What kind of tension?
    Because of the great Ninja War the ninja village has been struggling.
    They want for funds from the kingdom.
    However the courts want to put the funds into the army.
*   I hope she is safe too.
